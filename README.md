# Merlin ðŸ§™

A deep learning toolkit using TensorFlow 2 and Python 3.7+

This is a work in progress.

-   Read the [design document](design.md)
-   See some [illustrative examples](examples/)
-   See some [real world examples](https://github.com/ethereon/alchemy)

A relatively recent [nightly build of TensorFlow v2](https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly-2.0-preview/) is required for Merlin (although the [beta](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta) should mostly work).
